## Tanstack query

In the provided code snippet, the `prefetchTodos` function is defined in the `client/pages/index.js` file. This function uses the `queryClient.prefetchQuery` method to prefetch the results of the `fetchTodos` query.

```tsx
// Import necessary dependencies, including queryClient and fetchTodos function

const prefetchTodos = async () => {
  // Use queryClient.prefetchQuery to prefetch the results of the fetchTodos query
  await queryClient.prefetchQuery({
    queryKey: ['todos'],  // Unique key to identify the query in the cache
    queryFn: fetchTodos,   // The function that fetches the todos data
  })
}
```

Explanation:

- `queryKey:` It is a unique identifier for the query. In this case, the query key is set to `['todos']`. This key is used to identify the query in the cache.

- `queryFn:` This is the function that fetches the data. In the example, it's `fetchTodos`. This function is responsible for making the actual network request to get the todos data.

- `await queryClient.prefetchQuery:` This line initiates the prefetching process. It asynchronously prefetches the data and stores it in the cache with the specified query key.
