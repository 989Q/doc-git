# Deleting the Current Git Branch

When managing Git repositories, it's essential to clean up branches that are no longer necessary. This guide provides a structured approach to deleting the current Git branch, both locally and remotely.

## Deleting Locally

To remove the current branch from your local repository, adhere to the following steps:

**1. Switch to a Different Branch:**

   Before deleting the current branch, ensure you're on a different branch. Execute the following command to switch branches:
   ```bash
   $ git checkout <branch_name>
   ```
   Replace `<branch_name>` with the desired branch name, often `master` or another relevant branch.

**2. Delete the Branch:**

   Once you've switched to a different branch, delete the current branch using:
   ```bash
   $ git branch -d <branch_name>
   ```
   If the branch contains unmerged changes, Git will display an error. In such cases, force delete the branch with:
   ```bash
   $ git branch -D <branch_name>
   ```

## Deleting Remotely

Deleting the branch from the remote repository requires a straightforward command:

```bash
$ git push origin --delete <branch_name>
```

Replace `<branch_name>` with the name of the branch you intend to delete.
